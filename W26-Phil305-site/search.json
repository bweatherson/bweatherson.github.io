We will look at propositional logic, the logic of modals and conditionals, probability theory and game theory. Obviously that’s a lot to cover in a short time. The aim here is to make sure you understand the basics, and the symbolism, so you can follow simple applications of these tools, and you have the foundations to understand more complicated applications."

Ankita is offered the following bet - if it lands heads she wins $200, and if it lands tails she loses $100. Do we know enough to advise Ankita whether or not she should take the bet? Why or why not?\n\nWe do not know enough. We need to know the utility of gaining $200 and of losing $100, and which of these is larger. The theory doesn’t tell us these; it’s up to her how much she values these things. So as it stands, we don’t know enough to advise her.\n\nExplain why the following decision rule is not generally reasonable: Identity the most likely state; then choose an act which maximizes utility in that state. (Hint: Describe a situation where this would lead to doing something unreasonable.)\n\nConsider a choice with the following table, where state A has probability 0.6, and state B has probability 0.4.\n\n\n\nOptions\nState A\nState B\n\n\n\n\nOption X\n1\n-100000\n\n\nOption Y\n0\n0\n\n\n\nThe most likely outcome is A. And in A, X is the best option. But doing X is not in fact reasonable. Here is a real life case of this. You’re driving, and the light ahead is red. There are cars on the cross street. But they aren’t travelling fast, and if you just run the red light they’ll probably stop. Probably. But running the light has a marginal gain, and if you’re wrong about whether they’ll stop, it would be catastrophic.

For Eleanor, a job at Google has utility 200 while a job at Facebook has utility 50.\n\nWhat is the expected utility of going to Wayne State for Eleanor?\n\nSuppose Michigan State students have better odds of getting a job at Google: 5/400. And 360/400 students go to work at Amazon, which Eleanor would prefer to Facebook. On the other hand, the remaining 35/400 of them don’t get a job at all, which has utility zero for Eleanor. After thinking about it, she can’t decide: Wayne State and Michigan State seem like equally good options to her.\n\nHow much utility does working at Amazon have for Eleanor?\n\nSuppose Eleanor ends up going to Wayne State, and now she’s about to graduate. Unfortunately, Google isn’t hiring any more. The only jobs available are at Amazon and Facebook. She would have to take a special summer training program to qualify for a job at Amazon, though. And that would mean she can’t get a job at Facebook. Facebook is offering her a job, but she has to take it now or never. So, she has to either take the guaranteed job at Facebook right now, or gamble on the summer program. The summer program could get her a job at Amazon, or it could leave her unemployed.\n\nHow high would the probability of getting a job at Amazon have to be for Eleanor to be indifferent between taking and not taking the special summer program?"

After thinking about it, she can’t decide: Wayne State and Michigan State seem like equally good options to her.\n\nHow much utility does working at Amazon have for Eleanor?\n\nSuppose Eleanor ends up going to Wayne State, and now she’s about to graduate. Unfortunately, Google isn’t hiring any more. The only jobs available are at Amazon and Facebook. She would have to take a special summer training program to qualify for a job at Amazon, though. And that would mean she can’t get a job at Facebook. Facebook is offering her a job, but she has to take it now or never. So, she has to either take the guaranteed job at Facebook right now, or gamble on the summer program. The summer program could get her a job at Amazon, or it could leave her unemployed.\n\nHow high would the probability of getting a job at Amazon have to be for Eleanor to be indifferent between taking and not taking the special summer program?"
