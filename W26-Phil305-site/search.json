    "text": "Course Description\nThis course will introduce some important formal tools that are used elsewhere in philosophy. We will look at propositional logic, the logic of modals and conditionals, probability theory and game theory. Obviously that’s a lot to cover in a short time. The aim here is to make sure you understand the basics, and the symbolism, so you can follow simple applications of these tools, and you have the foundations to understand more complicated applications."

Be sure to cite work that you use, both direct quotations and paraphrased ideas. Any citation method that is tolerably clear is permitted, but if you’d like a good description of a citation scheme that works well in philosophy, look at http://bit.ly/VDhRJ4.\nYou are encouraged to discuss the course material, including assignments, with your classmates, but all written work that you hand in under your own name must be your own. If work is handed is as the work of two people, you are affirming that each person did a fair share of the work. (Note that when you’re submitting work on Canvas, you have to each submit the paper, even if it is co-authored. That way Canvas knows that everyone has turned in work.)\nYou should also be familiar with the academic integrity policies of the College of Literature, Science & the Arts at the University of Michigan, which are available here: http://www.lsa.umich.edu/academicintegrity/. Violations of these policies will be reported to the Office of the Assistant Dean for Student Academic Affairs, and sanctioned with a course grade of F."
