<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="marginal-utility-and-decision-making">Marginal Utility and Decision Making</h2>
<ul>
<li>Getting $2x is not twice as valuable as getting $x.</li>
<li>That’s because it’s like getting $x, then getting $x again.</li>
<li>And after you get the first $x, you’re richer, and getting $x is (in general) less valuable to richer people.</li>
</ul>

<section id="philosophical-point" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="philosophical-point">Philosophical Point</h2>
<p>It’s relatively uncontroversial that the following two things are true. The philosophical claim that lies behind the theory I’m setting out in these slides is that they are closely connected.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You’re better off getting a million dollars than getting a 50/50 shot at two million dollars.</li>
<li>Getting a million dollars changes your life more than it changes the life of a billionaire.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both are grounded in the fact that the more money you have, the less utility each extra dollar has.</p>
</section>
<section id="utility-and-money" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="utility-and-money">Utility and Money</h2>
<p>The graph of the relationship between utility and money should have the following two features.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>More money means more utility.</li>
<li>The amount of extra utility you get for each extra dollar should be decreasing</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s look at some familiar mathematical functions that satisfy that description.</p>
</section>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="utility-as-square-root-1">Utility as Square Root</h2>
<ul>
<li>This curves down, but not particularly quickly.</li>
<li>It is a nice toy model of the relationship between utility and money, especially because square roots are easy enough to calculate, but it isn’t that realistic. </li>
<li>Let’s try a different function.</li>
<li>I’ll use a logarithmic function, but I’ll ignore values below $1,000 because the numbers get weird.</li>
<li>This is obviously a big thing to ignore!</li>

<ul>
<li>This is a bit more plausible.</li>
<li>But what about all those dollars below $1,000?</li>
<li>Big thing about way to understand these graphs.</li>
<li>The x-axis measure net total wealth.</li>
<li>It does not measure size of bank account.</li>
<li>It includes things like the value of clothes in one’s wardrobe, food in one’s fridge/pantry, dishes/saucepans in one’s kitchen etc and, if one is particularly wealthy, any means of transportation one has (car, bike, etc.).</li>
<li>Those can fall below $1,000 - but life is hard below that point.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="expected-value-of-bets" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="expected-value-of-bets">Expected Value of Bets</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don’t think about how much money the bettor stands to gain or lose.</li>
<li>Instead, think about the possible end-states of the bet.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="example-using-log10-function" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-using-log10-function">Example (using Log10 Function)</h2>
<p>Imagine that our person currently has $100,000 in net wealth. </p>
<ul>
<li>They are offered a bet that has a 50% chance of winning $900,000, and a 50% chance of losing $90,000.</li>
<li>What should they think about the bet?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="example-using-log10-function-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-using-log10-function-1">Example (using Log10 Function)</h2>
<p>They should be indifferent between taking and declining the bet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Right now, they have utility 5 (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(log(10^5) = 5\)</span>.) </li>
<li>If they take the bet, they could end up with $10,000 or $1,000,000, with equal probability.</li>
<li>That is, they could end up with utility 4 or 6.</li>
<li>And each of those are equally likely.</li>
<li>So the expected utility of taking the bet is 5 - just like the status quo.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="is-this-realistic" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-this-realistic">Is this Realistic?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I’m not sure!</li>
<li>It seems rather risk averse to me, but the difference in quality of life between having $100,000 and having $10,000 is pretty substantial.</li>
<li>In one of those you can have a decent car, a nice wardrobe and kitchen, and enough spare cash to make rent each month or handle a small crisis without problems.</li>
<li>In the other you can maybe have 1 of those 3.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="change-the-example" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="change-the-example">Change the Example</h2>
<p>Imagine that our person currently has $100,000 in net wealth.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are offered a bet that has a 50% chance of winning $800,000, and a 50% chance of losing $90,000.</li>
<li>What should they think about the bet? </li>
<li>It’s worse than the previous one, so they shouldn’t take it.</li>
<li>That’s even though it’s expected dollar return is very very positive.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="inverting-the-example" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inverting-the-example">Inverting the Example</h2>
<p>Imagine that our person has $10,000, plus an asset of very uncertain value.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s got a 50% chance of being worth nothing, and a 50% chance of being worth $890,000.</li>
<li>Someone offers to buy it from them for $90,000, and they will have no other chance to sell it.</li>
<li>What should they do?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="take-the-deal" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="take-the-deal">Take the Deal</h2>
<p>This is just the same as the previous example. They have two choices.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A sure $100,000.</li>
<li>A 50/50 chance of either $10,000 or $900,000.</li>
</ol>
<p>And they should (given this utility function) take option 1.</p>
</section>
<section id="sporting-example" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sporting-example">Sporting Example</h2>
<ul>
<li>A young pitcher with not many assets ($10,000 including his old car, his sports gear etc) is offered $90,000 to sign with a pro team.</li>
<li>He is told, reliably by an agent, that if he plays college ball for a year, there’s a 50/50 chance that he’ll get a great deal next year, one worth $890,000.</li>
<li>But there’s also a 50/50 chance that he’ll regress, get injured etc, and get nothing.</li>
<li>What should he do?</li>
<li>On this model, he should take the deal.</li>
<li>And of course the team should offer him the deal, even if they think there is a 50% chance that he’s of no value to the team.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="insurance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="insurance">Insurance</h2>
<p>Insurance is a funny business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every insurance contract is a bet, with you and the insurance company on opposite sides of it.</li>
<li>The bet can’t, as a matter of almost mathematical necessity, have a positive expected dollar return for both of you.</li>
<li>And given it involves some transaction costs, it could have a negative expected dollar return for both of you.</li>
<li>So why does the industry even exist?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="declining-marginal-utility" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="declining-marginal-utility">Declining Marginal Utility</h2>
<p>Well let’s work through an example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume our person has assets of $100,000, including a car worth $30,000.</li>
<li>They live in a risky area, so there is a 1 in 10 chance the car will fall in value to 0 over the next 12 months.</li>
<li>They are offered an insurance contract with the following terms.</li>
<li>They pay $3,200.</li>
<li>If the risky thing happens and the car value falls to 0, the insurance company will reimburse them, so they will get the $30,000 back.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="should-they-take-the-deal" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="should-they-take-the-deal">Should They Take the Deal</h2>
<p>Outcome if they take the deal</p>
<ul>
<li>A guaranteed $96,800. </li>
</ul>
<p>Outcome if they don’t take the deal.</p>
<ul>
<li>A 90% chance of $100,000.</li>
<li>A 10% chance of $70,000. </li>
</ul>
<p>The latter outcome has an expected dollar return of $97,000 - that’s <span class="math inline">\(0.9 \times 100,000 + 0.1 \times 70,000\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="should-they-take-the-deal-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="should-they-take-the-deal-1">Should They Take the Deal</h2>
<ul>
<li>But this doesn’t settle the matter. We care about utility not dollars.</li>
<li>Let’s re-run the question using utility.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="should-they-take-the-deal-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="should-they-take-the-deal-2">Should They Take the Deal</h2>
<p>Outcome if they take the deal</p>
<ul>
<li>A guaranteed $96,800, which has utility roughly 4.986 </li>
</ul>
<p>Outcome if they don’t take the deal.</p>
<ul>
<li>A 90% chance of $100,000, which has utility 5.</li>
<li>A 10% chance of $70,000, which has utility roughly 4.845 </li>
</ul>
<p>The latter outcome has an expected utility return of roughly <span class="math inline">\(0.9 \times 5 + 0.1 \times 4.845 \approx 4.984\)</span>. Option 1 is better - not by much, but better.</p>
</section>
<section id="company-point-of-view" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="company-point-of-view">Company Point of View</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assume (for now) that they have a constant marginal utility of money.</li>
<li>So all that matters is that the policy has a positive dollar value.</li>
<li>And the expected dollar return of the deal is +$200, so it’s good for the company as well.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="success" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="success">Success!</h2>
<ul>
<li>We found a case where both parties are rational in taking the bet, even though they are on opposite sides of it.</li>
<li>And this doesn’t require fraud, or misperception of the odds for either party.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="possibility-constraints" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="possibility-constraints">Possibility Constraints</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is only possible because the two sides have different utility curves, at least locally.</li>
<li>That’s what makes the conflicting interests (in dollar terms) into a possible mutual interest.</li>
<li>Someone with a less steeply sloping utility curve (i.e., with more resources) is in a better position to absorb certain risks.</li>
<li>It is worth paying over the odds to them to absorb that risk.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="curves-almost-always-slope-down" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="curves-almost-always-slope-down">Curves (Almost) Always Slope Down</h2>
<ul>
<li>But eventually, the insurance company has risks it shudders at as well.</li>
<li>This only happens on enormous scale, but it happens.</li>
<li>And it’s why insurance companies won’t (happily) offer insurance against correlated risks, like floods or invasion.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="a-big-caveat" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-big-caveat">A Big Caveat</h2>
<p>When you run the numbers on cases like this, three things come out.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sometimes, insurance is good for both parties. </li>
<li>Unless the loss is a huge portion of the customer’s wealth, the numbers end up being really close. </li>
<li>Even in those cases, the numbers aren’t that different.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I end up thinking that people probably over-purchase insurance, even though this is a model on which insurance purchase can be rational.</p>
</section>
<section id="for-next-time" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="for-next-time">For Next Time</h2>
<ul>
<li>We will end the week with a famous puzzle about the relationship between utility and money.</li>
</ul>
