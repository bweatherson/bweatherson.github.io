<p>Suppose Michigan is deciding whether to enact a new tax. If the tax is enacted, it will bring in <span class="math inline">\(\$700\)</span> million in revenue. But it could also hurt the economy. The chance of harm to the economy is small, just <span class="math inline">\(1/5\)</span>. But it would cost the country <span class="math inline">\(\$1,200\)</span> million in lost earnings.

<p>After giving her calculus midterm, Professor X always offers her students a chance to improve their grade by trying to solve an optional “challenge” problem. If they get it right, their grade is increased by one letter grade: F changes to D, D changes to C, etc. But if they get it wrong, their grade goes down by one letter-grade: A changes to B, B changes to C, etc.</p>
<p>Hui got a C on his midterm. He asks the professor how often students get the challenge problem right and she says they get it right half the time. Hui decides to stick with his C. But he would be willing to try the challenge problem if the chances of getting it right were higher: <span class="math inline">\(2/3\)</span> or more. Suppose getting a D has utility <span class="math inline">\(5/10\)</span> for Hui, while a B has utility <span class="math inline">\(8/10\)</span>.</p>

<p>Eleanor wants to get a job at Google so she’s going to university to study computer science. She has to decide between Wayne State and Michigan State. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(1/100\)</span> of Wayne State’s computer science students get jobs at Google and the rest get jobs at Facebook. For Eleanor, a job at Google has utility <span class="math inline">\(200\)</span> while a job at Facebook has utility <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span>.</p>

<li>What is the expected utility of going to Wayne State for Eleanor?</li>

<p>Suppose Michigan State students have better odds of getting a job at Google: <span class="math inline">\(5/400\)</span>. And <span class="math inline">\(360/400\)</span> students go to work at Amazon, which Eleanor would prefer to Facebook. On the other hand, the remaining <span class="math inline">\(35/400\)</span> of them don’t get a job at all, which has utility zero for Eleanor. After thinking about it, she can’t decide: Wayne State and Michigan State seem like equally good options to her.</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>How much utility does working at Amazon have for Eleanor?</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose Eleanor ends up going to Wayne State, and now she’s about to graduate. Unfortunately, Google isn’t hiring any more. The only jobs available are at Amazon and Facebook. She would have to take a special summer training program to qualify for a job at Amazon, though. And that would mean she can’t get a job at Facebook. Facebook is offering her a job, but she has to take it now or never. So, she has to either take the guaranteed job at Facebook right now, or gamble on the summer program. The summer program could get her a job at Amazon, or it could leave her unemployed.</p>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li>How high would the probability of getting a job at Amazon have to be for Eleanor to be indifferent between taking and not taking the special summer program?</li>
