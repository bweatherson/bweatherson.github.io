# Overview

## Aim of Course

Introductory survey of some formal methods that are of broad philosophical use.

## Four Sections

1. Propositional Logic
2. Modal Logic and Conditionals
3. Probability and Decision
4. Game Theory

## Propositional Logic

- This is the logic of sentences that can be true or false, and that can combine to form longer sentences. 
- So as well as looking at simple sentences, like _Nadia sings_, we will look at sentences that are built from simple sentences.
- Examples of such sentences are _Nadia doesn't sing_, _Nadia sings and Bethany dances_, and _If Nadia sings, Simone sleeps_.

## Modal Logic

This is the logic of 'must' and 'might'.  It has as many applications as there are interpretations of 'must' and 'might'. The primary interpretations we'll look at are:

- Metaphysical 
- Epistemological  
- Moral 

## Probability and Decision

- Sometimes we can't infer that a conclusion is definitely true, but we can infer that it is probably true.
- We will look at some tools for regimenting how and when we make such inferences.
- We will also look at how these probabilities feed into decision making under uncertainty.

## Game Theory

- Finally, we will look at decisions in situations where other people are making similar decisions, and your return is affected by both what you and they do.
- The resulting theory is a very useful tool for coming up with simple models of complicated situations.

## Textbooks

There are four - all of them available through Canvas.

1. _forall x: Calgary Edition_ by P. D. Magnus, Tim Button, J. Robert Loftis, Robert Trueman, Aaron Thomas-Bolduc and Richard Zach.
2. _Boxes and Diamonds, Ann Arbor remix_, written by Richard Zach, and edited by me.
3. _Odds and Ends_ by Jonathan Weisberg.
4. _Game Theory_ by Giacomo Bonanno.

. . .

The four books are for the four parts of the course.

## Assessment

- The primary assessment will be weekly assignments, most of which will be administered through Canvas.
- Several are already posted, and they will be due each week on Thursday at 5pm.
- There are exceptions for this week, and the week after the mid-term break.
- There will also be an end of term exam.

## Syllabus

- The syllabus is available on Canvas. Indeed, it is the first thing that comes up when you load Canvas.
- Read it closely!
- It will tell you what we're covering each week, and where you should be each week.

# Arguments

## Quick Summary

We're discussing the nature of arguments, and in particular, the role of premises and conclusions.

### Associated Reading

forall x, chapter 1, "Arguments".

## Arguments

Logic studies certain properties of arguments.

An argument, in the sense we're interested in, has two parts:

. . .

1. Premises
2. Conclusion

## Example

&nbsp;
:    All kangaroos are wise.

&nbsp;
:    Skippy is a kangaroo.

$\therefore$
:    Skippy is wise.

. . .

Read $\therefore$ as 'therefore'.

## Premises

&nbsp;
:    All kangaroos are wise.

&nbsp;
:    Skippy is a kangaroo.

$\therefore$
:    Skippy is wise.

- The premises are the reasons that are given.
- In this argument there are two.

## Conclusion

&nbsp;
:    All kangaroos are wise.

&nbsp;
:    Skippy is a kangaroo.

$\therefore$
:    Skippy is wise.

The conclusion is what comes after 'therefore' and is supported by the premises.

## Ordinary English

- In ordinary English, the order of the premises and conclusion is not as fixed as it is here.
- The textbook has examples where the conclusion comes after the premises, as in our presentations, before the premises, and between the premises.
- The general rule is that it is introduced by a word like 'so', or 'therefore', or, if you're really old school, 'hence'.

## The Premise Set

&nbsp;
:    All kangaroos are wise.

&nbsp;
:    Skippy is a kangaroo.

$\therefore$
:    Skippy is wise.

There can be zero, one or multiple premises. Formally, we'll say there is a set of premises.

## Zero Premises

Here's my formal representation of (part of) the opening sentence of the Declaration of Independence.

. . .

$\therefore$
:    All men are created equal.

. . .

  
   
Saying that something is self-evident is a way of saying that it follows from no background at all.   

## One Premise

&nbsp;
:    The cinema is closed.

$\therefore$
:    We shouldn't go to the cinema.

. . .

This isn't what we'll call a **valid** argument, but it's a perfectly good argument in lots of contexts.

## Conclusion

&nbsp;
:    All kangaroos are wise.

&nbsp;
:    Skippy is a kangaroo.

$\therefore$
:    Skippy is wise.

We don't allow this flexibility to conclusions.  
Arguments have a single conclusion.

## Chained Arguments

- Sometimes a conclusion of one argument will go to be a premise in another argument.
- But any given argument aims to prove just one thing.

## Representation

&nbsp;
:    All kangaroos are wise.

&nbsp;
:    Skippy is a kangaroo.

$\therefore$
:    Skippy is wise.

When I write arguments like this, I'm merely presenting them, not asserting that they have any nice features.


# Validity

## Overview of Section

Introducing the concept of validity.

### Associated Reading

forall x, chapter 2, "The Scope of Logic".

## Virtues of Arguments

Here are some good making features of arguments.

::: {.incremental}

- Premises are true.
- Premises are known. 
- Premises are accepted in debate. 
- Premises are evidence for the conclusion.
- Premises guarantee the truth of the conclusion.
:::

## Logic

To a first approximation, logic is about the last of these virtues.

::: {.incremental}
- Does the truth of a set of premises **guarantee** the truth of the conclusion?
- If so, we'll say the argument is **valid**.
:::

## Guarantee

What is it for the premises to guarantee truth?

::: {.incremental}
- It's for every **case** where the premises are true to also be a case where the conclusion is true.
- That's nice, you might say, but what's a case?
:::

## Cases

- This, I'm afraid, we're going to leave a little abstract. 
- As the book in effect notes, it's probably best to leave this as a placeholder.
- Different notions of what a case are get you different notions of what arguments are valid.
- But you get into deep metaphysical waters here pretty fast; let's retreat to some definitions.

## Terminology

When an argument, with premises $P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n$ and conclusion $C$ is valid, we'll say all the following things are true.

::: {.incremental}
- The premises **entail** the conclusion.
- The conclusion **follows from** the premises.
- The conclusion is a **consequence** of the premises.
:::

## Invalid

- An argument is **invalid** just in case it is not valid.
- That is, it is **invalid** if there is a case where the premises are true and the conclusion false.

## Structure

- Logic is largely about validity, about which premises guarantee the truth of which conclusions.
- It's about a special kind of guarantee, one that holds in virtue of the **structure** or **form** of the premises and conclusion.

## A Valid Argument

&nbsp;
:    All kangaroos are wise.

&nbsp;
:    Skippy is a kangaroo.

$\therefore$
:    Skippy is wise.

## Non-Structural Guarantee

Compare the Skippy argument with this one.

&nbsp;
:    Today is Wednesday.

$\therefore$
:    Tomorrow is Thursday.

The premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion, but it does so in virtue of the meanings of 'Wednesday' and 'Thursday', not structural features.

## Form and Structure

- In the book they talk about the **form** of arguments.
- This is just the same thing as I'm meaning by **structure**.
- There is something about the Skippy example that's special; just the form of the argument shows that it is valid.

## Structure and Substitution

When the structure of the argument does the guaranteeing, the guarantee would persist through some substitutions.

&nbsp;
:    All kangaroos are wise.

&nbsp;
:    Skippy is a kangaroo.

$\therefore$
:    Skippy is wise.

## Structure and Substitution

When the structure of the argument does the guaranteeing, the guarantee would persist through some substitutions.

&nbsp;
:    All kangaroos are wise.

&nbsp;
:    Lucky is a kangaroo.

$\therefore$
:    Lucky is wise.

## Structure and Substitution

When the structure of the argument does the guaranteeing, the guarantee would persist through some substitutions.

&nbsp;
:    All koalas are wise.

&nbsp;
:    Lucky is a koala.

$\therefore$
:    Lucky is wise.

## Structure and Substitution

When the structure of the argument does the guaranteeing, the guarantee would persist through some substitutions.

&nbsp;
:    All koalas are dishonest.

&nbsp;
:    Lucky is a koala.

$\therefore$
:    Lucky is dishonest.

## Terminology

- We'll say an argument is **valid** just in case the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.
- We'll say an argument is **formally valid**, or occasionally **logically valid**, if it is valid, and any argument with the same form/structure is valid.
- We'll say an argument is **sound** just in case it is valid and has true premises.
- We won't have much interest here in soundness; just in validity.

## Structure

- You might have noticed that I never actually defined what it is for two arguments to share a structure.
- I just said that changing a name (consistently throughout the argument), or changing a noun/adjective (consistently) preserves structure.
- But I didn't say more than that.
- Hold that thought! We'll have quite a lot to say as the course goes on about this notion of structure.

## Validity

Here are some equivalent ways to define validity.

- An argument is valid if necessarily, when the premises are true, the conclusion is too.
- An argument is valid if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to not be true.

We'll use that last formulation a lot.

## For Next Time

We'll start our look at the most fundamental kind of logic: propositional logic.
