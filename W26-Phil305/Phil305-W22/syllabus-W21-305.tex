\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course will introduce some important formal tools that are used
elsewhere in philosophy. We will look at propositional logic,
probability theory and the logic of modals and conditionals. Obviously
that's a lot to cover in a short time - the aim here is to make sure you
understand the basics, and the symbolism, so you can follow simple
applications of these tools, and you have the foundations to understand
more complicated applications.

\hypertarget{canvas}{%
\section{Canvas}\label{canvas}}

There is a Canvas site for this course, which can be accessed from
\url{https://canvas.umich.edu}. Course documents (syllabus, lecture
notes, assignments) will be available from this site. Please make sure
that you can access this site. Consult the site regularly for
announcements, including changes to the course schedule. And there are
many tools on the site to communicate with each other, and with me.

\hypertarget{required-materials}{%
\section{Required Materials}\label{required-materials}}

There are three textbooks for the course. All of them are open access,
and hence free. The third is on Canvas, the other two have to be
downloaded from elsewhere.

\hypertarget{course-requirements}{%
\section{Course Requirements}\label{course-requirements}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There will be 10 weekly quizzes. Of these your best 8 will count
  towards your grade, with each counting for 10\%.
\item
  There will also be a final exam, given through Canvas, that counts for
  20\% of the grade.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{summary-of-grading-system}{%
\section{Summary of Grading System}\label{summary-of-grading-system}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Weekly assignments - 10\% each, 8 assignments count, 80\% total.
\item
  Final exam - 20\%.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{plagiarism}{%
\section{Plagiarism}\label{plagiarism}}

Although team-work, and even co-authorship, is encouraged, plagiarism is
strictly prohibited. You are responsible for making sure that none of
your work is plagiarized. Be sure to cite work that you use, both direct
quotations and paraphrased ideas. Any citation method that is tolerably
clear is permitted, but if you'd like a good description of a citation
scheme that works well in philosophy, look at
\url{http://bit.ly/VDhRJ4}.

You are encouraged to discuss the course material, including
assignments, with your classmates, but all written work that you hand in
under your own name must be your own. If work is handed is as the work
of two people, you are affirming that each person did a fair share of
the work. (Note that when you're submitting work on Canvas, you have to
each submit the paper, even if it is co-authored. That way Canvas knows
that everyone has turned in work.)

You should also be familiar with the academic integrity policies of the
College of Literature, Science \& the Arts at the University of
Michigan, which are available here:
\url{http://www.lsa.umich.edu/academicintegrity/}. Violations of these
policies will be reported to the Office of the Assistant Dean for
Student Academic Affairs, and sanctioned with a course grade of F.

\hypertarget{disability}{%
\section{Disability}\label{disability}}

The University of Michigan abides by the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and other
applicable federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination on the
basis of disability, which mandate that reasonable accommodations be
provided for qualified students with disabilities.

If you have a disability, and may require some type of instructional
and/or examination accommodation, please contact me early in the
semester. If you have not already done so, you will also need to
register with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities. The
office is located at G664 Haven Hall.

For more information on disability services at the University of
Michigan, go to \url{http://ssd.umich.edu}.

\hypertarget{virtual}{%
\section{Virtual}\label{virtual}}

This course is being taught virtually because of the still raging
pandemic. Hopefully we all learned a bit from virtual teaching/learning
in the Fall, but it's still new for a lot of us. I suspect I'll get some
things wrong, and I'll have to make adjustments on the fly. If/when that
happens, I'll do everything I can to make sure everything is done fairly
- but if I don't, you should let me know that I'm messing up.

The college has put a lot of things in place for this rather distinctive
semester, including extended add/drop deadlines, and a new grade of NRC.
I won't repeat here all of what they've done, in part because I suspect
that will be changing as the semester goes along. But I wanted you to
know that I know this semester will be a challenge for all of us. And
I'll do what I can to make it as productive an educational experience as
it can be - even if that isn't as good as what you'd have hoped for.

\newpage

\hypertarget{class-schedule}{%
\section{Class Schedule}\label{class-schedule}}

The readings will all be from the three textbooks. I'll produce short
videos going over the material in the book, and occasionally other
philosophically interesting points. Then the time in class will be
entirely spent on questions people have, and going over worked examples.
So you should do the reading, and watch the lectures, before the
scheduled class.

The video lectures will have a number of the form \(x.y\), where \(x\)
is the week they are for, and the \(y\) is their order in the week.
There will typically be 8-10 lectures each week, each of them roughly
10-12 minutes.
