It doesn't look at *strength* of preference.\n- The output doesn't just ask for a winner, but for a full ordering.\n\n## A Non-Answer\n\nSay A >~$\\forall$~ B if more people have A >~i~ B than have B >~$\\forall$~ A, and A =~$\\forall$~ B if the numbers are the same.\n\nThis is a very simple kind of majoritarian rule.\n\n## Condorcet Again\n\nYou can probably see where this is going. \n\n- Imagine that there are three options, A, B and C.\n- And there are three voters, X, Y and Z.\n- X has A >~X~ B >~X~ C.\n- Y has B >~Y~ C >~Y~ A.\n- Z has C >~Z~ A >~Z~ B.\n\n## Condorcet Again\n\n- Since two people (X and Z) prefer A to B, we have A >~$\\forall$~ B.\n- Since two people (X and Y) prefer B to C, we have B >~$\\forall$~ C.\n- Since two people (Y and Z) prefer C to A, we have C >~$\\forall$~ A.\n- And we've violated transitivity.\n\n## Plurality Again\n\nLet's try a different solution.\n\n- Ignore every part of >~i~ except who is top.\n- For each option, give it 1 point for every voter for which it's the top option.\n- If the voter has two options tied for top, give then 1/2 point each, and so on for more ties.\n- Rank the options by how many points.\n\n## Plurality Again\n\n- This is guaranteed to satisfy the assumptions.\n- Any approach where each option gets a number, and you rank the numbers, will produce the right kind of ordering.\n- But it has a very strange result.\n\n## Plurality Again\n\nImagine there are three options, A, B and C, and 100 voters. On Monday the preferences are like this:\n\n- 40 people have A > B > C.\n- 35 people have B > C > A.\n- 25 people have C > B > A.\n- So A wins, with 40 votes, and B is second, with 35.\n\n## Plurality Again\n\nOn Tuesday, 10 of the people in the last group change their mind, just about B and C. So now we have.\n\n- 40 people have A > B > C.\n- 45 people have B > C > A.\n- 15 people have C > B > A.\n- So now B moves ahead of A in the social ranking, even though no one changed their mind abiout A and B.\n- Is this odd?\n\n# The Theorem\n\n## Arrow's Approach\n\nRather than going through options one at a time, let's find some principles.\n\n- Start with a list of things we'd like the aggregation to be like.\n- See what kind of things could meet all of the requirements on our list.\n\n## Arrow's Theorem\n\nFor a very natural set of requirements, there are **zero** aggregation rules that satisfy all of them.\n\n- Any aggregation rule you pick will have some slightly odd feature.\n\n## Arrow's Requirements\n\nArrow identified four conditions that seem essential for any fair democratic system:\n\n1. **Unrestricted Domain** (U)\n2. **Weak Pareto Principle** (P)  \n3. **Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives** (I)\n4. **Non-dictatorship** (D)\n\n## Unrestricted Domain (U)\n\n**What it means**: The voting system must work for ANY possible combination of individual preference rankings.\n\n**Why it seems reasonable**: We shouldn't restrict what preferences people are allowed to have in a democracy.\n\n## Weak Pareto Principle (P)\n\n**What it means**: If everyone prefers alternative A to alternative B, then the group ranking should also prefer A to B.\n\n**Why it seems reasonable**: If there's unanimous agreement, the social choice should reflect that agreement.\n\n## Vilfredo Pareto\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![Vilfredo Pareto](images/pareto.jpg)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n- Lived 1848-1923.\n- Trained in Turin, worked primarily at Lausanne.\n- He died around the time Mussolini came to power, and the Italian fascists claimed him as an inspiration. This *may* have been a misreading; he often sounds like a classical liberal. \n:::\n\n::::\n\n## Pareto Principles\n\n**Weak Pareto**: If for all i, A >~i~ B, then A >~$\\forall$~ B.\n\n**Strong Pareto**: If for some i, A >~i~ B, and for no i B >~i~ A (but maybe there are some ties), then A >~$\\forall$~ B.\n\nThe latter is more contentious, but it isn't needed for the proof.\n\n(In fact, all that the proof really needs is that every outcome is possible.)\n\n## Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (I)\n\n**What it means**: The social ranking between any two alternatives should depend *only* on how individuals rank those two alternatives, not on how they rank other alternatives.\n\n**Key Insight**: If we're deciding between A and B, it shouldn't matter what people think about C.\n\n## IIA: Formal Statement\n\n**Formal Definition**: For any two preference profiles R and R', if every individual has the same preference between alternatives A and B in both profiles, then the social choice between A and B must be the same in both profiles.\n\nThis isn't a property of how the aggregation function treats what happens on any given day; it's a property of how it treats possible changes in individual preferences.\n\n## Non-dictatorship (D)\n\n**What it means**: No single individual's preferences should always determine the group ranking, regardless of what others prefer.\n\n**Why it seems reasonable**: This is basic to democratic ideals - no one person should have absolute power.\n\n## Non-dictatorship (D)\n\n**Formal statement**: For every individual i, there is some profile R and some pair of options A and B such that in R, A >~i~ B, but not A >~$\\forall$~ B.\n\n**Note**: This doesn't prevent someone from being influential, just from being decisive in every case.\n\n## Non-Dictatorship (D)\n\nYou might have wanted a stronger condition, like this one. But it turns out D is enough to get the result.\n\nAnonymity (A)\n:    If two people switch their preferences, so on Tuesday X has the views that Y had on Monday, and Y has the views that X had on Monday, that shouldn't change the answer.\n\n## The Impossibility Theorem\n\n**Arrow's Theorem**: There is no social choice function that simultaneously satisfies:\n\n- Unrestricted Domain (U)\n- Weak Pareto Principle (P)\n- Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (I)  \n- Non-dictatorship (D)\n\n## Proof\n\nI'm not going to make you sit through a proof here.
