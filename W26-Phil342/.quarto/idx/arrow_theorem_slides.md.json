Violating IIA**:\n- Initial preferences: Voter 1: A > B > C, Voter 2: B > A > C\n- Suppose social choice gives: A > B\n- Now C is removed from consideration\n- Preferences become: Voter 1: A > B, Voter 2: B > A  \n- IIA requires the social choice to still prefer A > B\n- Any system that now prefers B > A violates IIA\n\n**Example 2 - Why this matters**:\n- In presidential elections, the presence of a third-party candidate can change who wins between the two main candidates\n- This violates IIA and can lead to strategic voting\n\n---\n\n## Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives: Formal Statement\n\n**Formal Definition**: For any two preference profiles R and R', if every individual has the same preference between alternatives x and y in both profiles, then the social choice between x and y must be the same in both profiles.\n\n**In other words**:\n- Take any two alternatives: x and y\n- Consider two different voting scenarios\n- If each voter's preference between x and y is identical in both scenarios\n- Then the group's preference between x and y must also be identical\n\n**This rules out**: Systems where the presence/absence of other alternatives affects pairwise comparisons.\n\n---\n\n## Condition 4: Non-dictatorship (D)\n\n**What it means**: No single individual's preferences should always determine the group ranking, regardless of what others prefer.\n\n**Why it seems reasonable**: This is basic to democratic ideals - no one person should have absolute power.\n\n**Formal statement**: There should be no individual i such that for every preference profile, if individual i prefers x to y, then the social choice prefers x to y.\n\n**Note**: This doesn't prevent someone from being influential, just from being decisive in every case.\n\n---\n\n## The Impossibility Theorem\n\n**Arrow's Theorem**: There is no social choice function that simultaneously satisfies:\n- Unrestricted Domain (U)\n- Weak Pareto Principle (P)\n- Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (I)  \n- Non-dictatorship (D)\n\n**What this means**: Any democratic voting system must violate at least one of these seemingly reasonable conditions.\n\n**The Proof Strategy**: Arrow showed that assuming all four conditions leads to a logical contradiction.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters for Philosophy\n\n**Implications for Democratic Theory**:\n- Challenges the idea of \"the will of the people\"\n- Shows that aggregating preferences is fundamentally problematic\n- Raises questions about the legitimacy of democratic outcomes\n\n**Broader Philosophical Questions**:\n- What does this tell us about collective rationality?\n- Are there alternative approaches to social choice?\n- How should we respond to this impossibility?\n\n**Connection to Other Areas**:\n- Philosophy of mind (collective vs. individual rationality)\n- Political philosophy (legitimacy of democratic institutions)\n- Ethics (how to make fair collective decisions)\n\n---\n\n## Common Responses and Escape Routes\n\n**1. Restrict the Domain**: Limit the types of preferences allowed (violates U)\n\n**2. Accept Dictatorship**: In limited contexts, expert decision-making (violates D)\n\n**3. Drop IIA**: Accept that context matters in social choice (violates I)\n\n**4. Probabilistic Methods**: Use randomization or cardinal utilities\n\n**5. Alternative Frameworks**: Deliberative democracy, constitutional constraints\n\n**The Debate Continues**: Each response involves trade-offs and philosophical commitments.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion Questions\n\n1. Which of Arrow's four conditions would you be most willing to give up? Why?\n\n2. Does Arrow's Theorem show that democracy is impossible, or just that perfect democracy is impossible?\n\n3. How might this theorem apply to other collective decision-making contexts (committees, families, etc.)?\n\n4. Do you think the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives condition is actually reasonable? Can you think of cases where context should matter?\n\n5. What does this theorem tell us about the nature of collective rationality?","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"revealjs":{"identifier":{"display-name":"RevealJS","target-format":"revealjs","base-format":"revealjs"},"execute":{"fig-width":10,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.9/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full"},"slide-level":2,"to":"revealjs","css":["custom-styles_css.css"],"incremental":false,"highlight-style":"github","output-file":"arrow_theorem_slides.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
